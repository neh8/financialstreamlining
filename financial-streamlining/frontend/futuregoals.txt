Goals for the future/next sprint:
* Verify that the scoring system is correct
* Replace risk-assesment questions with knowledge questions
  * Also add a question that basically asks "what did you get on the risk assesment"
  * We will have to update/refactor the scoring system when we add new questions
* Reformat to one question per page
  * Add "Next" button for each question
  * Button takes users to a new page/view of the page that shows a different question
  * Submit button only appears after last question
  * Make it so you cannot continue to the next question until you have answered the current one
* Make answers appear in a random order (i.e. not the same order every time)
  * Goal: Make sure the assesment is testing finance knowledge (currently you can automatically get the "Advanced" label by always guessing D)
* Fix the CSS to match OpenFinAl styles
* Create "start quiz" and "results" pages
* Make "results" page direct user to appropriate resources
* Coordinate with the database people about the information we are collecting and how they want it formatted
* Add this to the OpenFinAl codebase once CSS is standardized and bugs are gone
* Clean up the code and make sure it's documented as we go
* Update the README (it currently contains the generic "Getting Started with React" instructions)
* Write some tests(?)
