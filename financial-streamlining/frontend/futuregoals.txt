Goals for next three days:
* Replace old survey questions
* Fix the CSS to match OpenFinAl styles

Goals for the future:
* Come up with a new scoring/categorizing system as a team
* Allow the user to change their answer if they made a mistake
  * Add a "back" button that goes to the previous page
  * Allow the user to update their selection (remove original answer from answers array, add new one)
* Make answers appear in a random order (i.e. not the same order every time)
  * Goal: Make sure the assesment is testing finance knowledge (currently you can automatically get the "Advanced" label by always guessing D)
* Choose 10 random questions out of the 15 each time a new user starts the survey
* Add this to the OpenFinAl codebase once CSS is standardized and bugs are gone
* Clean up the code and make sure it's documented as we go
* Figure out what dependencies we need to put in the OpenFinAl packages.json
* Fix instances where we are directly manipulating the DOM (HTML structure) in the JS functions and replace with using state
